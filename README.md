# multi_wave
This is the electromagnetic field analysis program for focused beams.
This program can analyze plane wave, focused plane wave, focused radial-azimuthal polarized beam.
In additon, spiral phase modulated beam ( like a Laguerre Gaussian beam ), and Bessel beam can be analyzed. 
This program also supports superposition of these beams. The analysis method used here based on Fourier optics.
